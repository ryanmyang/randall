----------------- LOG -----------------

I first added tests which were pretty simple to add:
@echo "Running tests..."
	./randall 10 | wc -c | grep -q '^10$$' && echo "Length 10 test valid" || echo "Length 10 test failed"
	./randall 453 | wc -c | grep -q '^453$$' && echo "Length 453 test valid" || echo "Length 453 test failed"

Then I started moving out pieces, but was having trouble figuring out which parts belonged where. I also kept running into forgetting about adding the dependencies into the makefiles. Also it wasn't compiling on my mac so I had to transfer it to the server to run so I made an sh file to make it faster to sync:

#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz ./ ryany@cs35l.seas.ucla.edu:CS35L/Assignment5/

I kept not realizing which includes were needed which was a bit annoying but I ended up getting them all in. 

To handle the options I made a struct to hold all of the data and initialized the struct in the main randall file.
struct options {
    bool valid;
    long long nbytes;
};
This is the struct for now.

Most of the transferring was just copy paste and fix includes.

Then I added the processing of the arguments by basically looking to see if any valid arguments had '-i', then I look at the next argument and see if it matches rdrand, mrand48_r, or starts with a slash. Then I store the input option that was chosen into the options struct.

Figuring out mrand48_r was a pain but I think I figured it out:

FILE *randomFile = fopen("/dev/random", "rb");

unsigned short seed[3];
size_t bytesRead = fread(seed, sizeof(unsigned short), 3, randomFile);
fclose(randomFile);
seed48_r(seed, &randomBuffer);
unsigned long randomValue;
    mrand48_r(&randomBuffer, (long *)&randomValue);
    printf("mrand48 randomValue: %d \n", randomValue);
    return randomValue;


While trying to add the input file features, I ran into the issue where I could not make the rand64 function pointer point to a function where I passed in the file as an argument and I was stuck for a bit on what to do. I decided on making another function in the software code that was called during options processing, and changed a static variable in the software code so that it would store the input file right away so I wouldn't have to pass it in during the calling of the random functions.

void set_file(char *file) {
    // printf("setting file");
    urandstream = fopen(file, "r");
    if (!urandstream) {
        printf("fopen urandstream failed");
        abort();
    }
}

I also ran into an abort issue but that ended up being caused by misplaced brackets after an if statement. This is why when I write if statements, that I like to always use the brackets even if it starts as one line long.

For output, I basically copied my handleinput function so that I can just pass in whatever is being output to validate and process it, which made it pretty easy.
I had issues a few times because of stupid things like forgetting to check ==0 for some string comparisons, so I was actually checking for the opposite of what I wanted to

I added a bunch of test cases and tried to hit all of the combinations and just checked that they were running correctly and outputting the correct amount of bytes of random info.
